# Mercury Live Coding Environment

**A minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music, focussed towards Algoraves.**

Programmed in Cycling'74s Max8 creative coding environment, as an abstracted layer on the Max/MSP audio engine and with the use of Javascript for parsing and lexing and Jitter and OpenGL for the visuals and the responsive texteditor.

## About 

Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music, focussed towards Algoraves. All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.
